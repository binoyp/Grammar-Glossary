>Simple Past
The Simple Past tense, also called the Past Simple, is used for past actions that happened either at a specific time, which can either be given by a time phrase (yesterday, last year, etc.) or understood from the context.  Regular verbs add -ed to the {Base Form}, or -d if the verbs ends with -e. An Irregular verb can change in many different ways; there is a fairly comprehensive list in the Irregular Verbs Section.  The verb form is the same for all persons:

	eg: I liked, you liked, she/he/it liked, we liked, they liked. 

NOTE:  After the {Auxiliary Verb}, Did/Didn't- the verb returns to the {Base Form}:

	eg: Did you take it?
	eg: She didn't like it.
See also {Tense}, {Present Simple}, {Auxiliary Verb}, {Base Form}, {Regular Verb}, {Irregular Verb}
>Past Simple
The Past Simple tense, also called the Simple Past, is used for past actions that happened either at a specific time, which can either be given by a time phrase (yesterday, last year, etc.) or understood from the context.  {Regular Verb} add -ed to the {Base Form}, or -d if the verbs ends with -e.  {Irregular Verb} can change in many different ways. The verb form is the same for all persons:

	eg: I liked, you liked, she/he/it liked, we liked, they liked. 

NOTE:  After the {Auxiliary Verb}, Did/Didn't, it returns to the {Base Form}:

	eg: Did you take it?
	eg: She didn't like it.
See also {Tense}, {Present Simple}, {Auxiliary Verb}, {Base Form}, {Regular Verb}, {Irregular Verb}
>Present Simple
The Present Simple (also called the Simple Present {Tense}) is used to describe:
	i/   Actions that are repeated or habitual
	ii/  States
	iii/ Statements that are always true
Examples:
	a) I get up at 9.00 am.
	b) I like coffee.
	c) The sun sets in the west.
The form of the verb is usually the same as the {Base Form}, but the third {Person} {Singular} adds -s.  Some verbs change, like 'to be', which uses 'am', 'are' and 'is', and 'to have', where the third person is 'has'.  The {Auxiliary Verb} 'to do' is used in a {Negative} structure or a {Question}:

Do you like tea?
Does she live nearby?

I don't like them.
She doesn't go to the theatre very often.

The third {Person} returns to the {Base Form} when 'does' or 'doesn't' are used.
>Gerund
FORMATION: {Base Form}+ ING
If a {Verb} ends with -e, it loses the last letter before adding the -ing {Suffix}.
A Gerund is a {Verb} when it acts as a {Noun}; it can act as the {Subject} or {Object} of a {Main Verb}.
eg: Studying is good for you.
Gerunds are used after prepositions, but not usually after 'to'.  Gerunds look identical to the {Present Participle}, which is used after the {Auxiliary Verb} 'to be', but are not the same as they do not function as main verbs.  The gerund is used after certain words and expressions, as is the {Infinitive}, so it is useful to try to learn which form an {Adjective}, etc., takes.

>Auxiliary Verb
'DO', 'BE' and 'HAVE' are the English auxiliary verbs used in a {Negative} structure, a {Question} or either Tense.

1/ 'DO', 'DON'T', 'DOES' and 'DOESN'T is used for questions and negatives in the {Present Simple} {Tense}, and 'DID' and 'DIDN'T' are used in the {Past Simple} {Tense}.

2/ 'BE' is used with the {Present Participle} in {Continuous Verbs}.

3/ 'HAVE' is used with the {Past Participle} to form the {Perfect} {Aspect}.

>Modal Verb
Modal verbs are used to express ideas such as possibility, intention, obligation and necessity.

CAN, COULD, WILL, WOULD, SHALL, SHOULD, DARE, OUGHT TO, DARE and NEED are some examples.

eg: I would have told you, if you had wanted me to.

eg: Yes, I can do that.

>Noun
A noun is a word used to refer to people, animals, objects, substances, states, events and feelings.  Nouns can be a {Subject} or an {Object} of a {Verb}, can be modified by an {Adjective} and can take an {Article}.
Nouns may be divided into two groups:
{Countable Noun} 
{Uncountable Noun}  
Countable Nouns have plural forms and Uncountable Nouns do not.
See {Concrete Noun}; {Abstract Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}
>Irregular Plurals
There are many different types of irregular nouns in English that do not add a final '-s'.  Some do not change (SHEEP), while others change internal letters (WOMAN- WOMEN), or add letters (CHILD- CHILDREN, OX- OXEN).

>Concrete Noun
A concrete noun refers to objects and substances, including people and animals, that exist physically.  They can be either an {Uncountable Noun} or a {Countable Noun}.
 eg: Clocks and watches exist physically and are Concrete Nouns.  Time is a concept that has no physical existence; it is not a Concrete Noun but an {Abstract Noun}.

>Proper Noun
Proper nouns are the names of individual people, places, titles, calendar times, etc..
 eg: Janet; Simon; London; The President; Tuesday.
Proper nouns are always written with a capital letter.  Nouns which are not written with a capital letter do not refer to the name of an individual person or thing and are called common nouns.

See {Concrete Noun}; {Abstract Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}
>Pronoun
A pronoun is a word that substitutes a {Noun} or {Noun Phrase}.  There are a number of different kinds in English:

1 \ {Demonstrative Pronoun}- this, that, these, those

>Personal Pronoun
I, you, he, she, it, we and they are the {Subject} personal pronouns used in English.  They are used to substitute the names of the people or things that perform actions.  In English, we make no distinction between singular and plural forms of "you".
 EG. She took the bus last night.  (She substitutes the name of the person who took the bus.) 
Me, you, him, her, it, us and them are the {Object} personal pronouns used in English.  They are used to substitute the names of the people or things that are affected by an action.
 EG. John took it.  (It substitutes the name of the thing that John took.)

>Reflexive Pronoun
Myself; yourself; himself; herself; itself; ourselves; yourselves; themselves are the reflexive pronouns.  They are used when the {Complement} of the verb is the same as the subject.

 EG. He shot himself. 

They can also be used to give more emphasis to the {Subject} or {Object}.
 EG. I did it myself. - I want to emphasise the fact that I did it.
     They spoke to the Director herself.  (Emphasising the importance of the Director)

>Noun Phrase
A noun phrase is either a single noun or pronoun or a group of words containing a {Noun} or a {Pronoun} that function together as a noun or pronoun, as the {Subject} or {Object} of a {Verb}.
 EG: John was late.
('John' is the noun phrase functioning as the subject of the verb.)  
 EG: The people that I saw coming in the building at nine o'clock have just left.
('The people ... nine o'clock' is a lengthy noun phrase, but it functions as the subject of the main verb 'have just left'.)

See {Concrete Noun}; {Abstract Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}
>Indefinite Article
There are two indefinite articles in English: 'a' and 'an'.  They are used before a singular {Noun} that has a {Plural} form.  'A' is used before a 'consonant' sound and 'an' is used before a vowel sound.  The sound is more important than the spelling; we say 'an umbrella' and 'a union' because the sounds of the first letter are different.

See also {Article}; {Definite Article}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}; {Singular}; {Plural}
>Subject
The subject or of a sentence is the {Noun}, {Pronoun} or {Noun Phrase} that precedes and governs the {Main Verb}.
 EG. He is a really nice guy.    ('He' is the subject of the sentence, controlling the verb and the {Complement}.
     My dog attacked the burglar.  ('My dog' is the subject, controlling the {Verb} and the rest of the {Sentence}.)

 EG: She closed the door.  ('door' is directly affected by her action. 

See also {Indirect Object}, {Intransitive Verb}; {Subject}, {Pronoun}; {Predicate}; {Transitive Verb}; {Verb} and {Complement}
>Verb
Verbs are one of the major grammatical groups, and all sentences must contain one. A verb refers to an action (do, break, walk, etc.) or a state (be, like, own). 

{Tense} shows the time of the action or state.  {Aspect} shows whether the action or state is completed or not.  {Voice} is used to show relationships between the action and the people affected by it.  {Mood} shows the attitude of the speaker about the verb, whether it is a declaration or an order.  Verbs can be affected by {Person} and {Number} to show agreement with the {Subject}.

>Numeral
A numeral is a word or phrase used for numbers; 'one' and 'first', etc..

See also {Cardinal Number}; {Ordinal Number}; {Singular}; {Plural}
>Tense
Tense is used to show the relation between the action or state described by the verb and the time, which is reflected in the form of the verb.  There are two basic tenses in English; the present and the past.  The present is like the {Base Form}, although the third person singular adds -s, and the past.  Regular verbs add -ed or -d to show the past tense, while irregular verbs change in many different ways, or not at all in some cases.

{Present Simple}; {Past Simple}; {Simple Past}

>Person
Person is a way of organising the pronouns used as the subject of a verb and each person can be either singular or plural:

			Singular		Plural
First Person:	I			We
This pronoun is used when the subject is the speaker or the group with them.
Second Person	You			You
This is used when the speaking is talking about the person or people they are speaking to.  In English, there is no difference between singular and plural and we use the same form whatever our relationship with the other person or people.
Third Person	He\She\It		They
This is used when the speaker to referring to an individual or thing that is outside the conversation or communication.  In the singular, we distinguish between male, female and objects, but not in the plural.

See also {Pronoun}; {Singular}; {Plural}; {Verb}
>Number
In {Grammar}; number is whether a word is singular or plural, especially nouns and demonstratives.

See also {Noun}; {Demonstrative}; {Singular}; {Plural}; {Cardinal Number}; {Ordinal Number}
>Synonym
A synonym is a word that means the same as another word, or more or less the same.

 EG: 'Movie' is a synonym of 'film'.  In this example the former is more common in American English and the latter in British English.  

See also {Antonym}; {Hyponym}; {Homophone}; {Homonym}; {Homograph}; {Word}; {Polysemy}; {Thesaurus}

>Punctuation
The symbols used in written language to indicate the end of a {Sentence} or a {Clause}, or to indicate that it is a question, etc., are the punctuation.

  . , ; : ? ! ' - " " () are the symbols most commonly used in English.

See also {Alphabet}; {Letter}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}; {Accent}
>Letter
There are 26 letters in the English {Alphabet}; the letters are the individual characters that are used to represent sounds in a written form, either individually or in combination with other letters.  Letters can be either {Lower Case} or {Upper Case}.  The latter are the larger versions of the letters that occur at the start of a sentence or the beginning of a {Proper Noun} and the term {Capital Letter} is also widely used for them.  Lower case letters are used for the other transcriptions. of the word or the sentence.

Upper case letters can also be used to highlight or emphasise important words, but people who overdo this, as so many do nowadays, end up achieving the opposite effect; a memo with twenty key words capitalised for effect will in all likelihood merely convince the reader that the writer has got a serious problem with prioritising.  The capital letter is also widely used to elevate ordinary and humble words to a higher status and sound more official.  When used judiciously, it can work well, but it seems that everyone wants to give every other word the dignity of a capital letter, like the modern craze for endlessly changes the names for things.  There is very little to get enthusiastic about with the way English is being used in media and professional circles these days.
>Sentence
A sentence is a group of words beginning with a {Capital Letter} and ending with a full-stop, containing a {Main Verb} in written language.

>Question
A question is a sentence, a phrase or even just a gesture that shows that the speaker or writer is asking for the reader or listener to supply them with some information, to perform a task or in some other way satisfy the request.

See also {Question types}; {Question Tag}; {Tail Question}; {Topic Sentence}; {Word}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}; {Clause}; {Letter}; {Prose}; {Poetry}; {Prosody}; {Text}; {Grammar}; {Syntax}
>Paragraph
A paragraph is an organisational feature of written English, and many other languages as well.  It is a group of sentences, or possibly a single {Sentence}, separated from the rest of the text by a space above and below it or by indenting the first line (leaving a space between the margin and the first word).  A paragraph usually contains sentences that deal with one topic, and a new paragraph signals a change of topic.

>Prose
Language can be divided into two basic categories; prose and {poetry}.  The latter is characterised by its use of rhythm, and the former by not using a regular rhythm, which is the case for the vast majority of spoken and written language.

See also {Prosody}; {Text}
>Poetry
Poetry is language where rhythm is an essential part of the communicative act, where words are used in a way similar to music to create an effect on the reader or listener.  Language which does not use rhythm and other effects in this way is called {Prose}.

See also {Prosody}; {Text}; {Rhyme}; {Rhyming Dictionary}; {Limerick}; {Stanza}
>Stanza
When a poem is divided into groups of lines, often with a regular pattern, these groups are known as STANZAS or VERSES.

{Poetry}; {Prosody}
>Prosody
Prosody is the study of the various rhythms used in {Poetry}.

See also {Prose}; {Text}; {Rhyme}; {Limerick}; {Stanza}
>Rhyme
When words at the end of lines of poetry have the same sound so that they work together to produce an effect, the {Poetry} has a rhyme.

See also {Prosody}; {Text}; {Rhyme}; {Limerick}; {Prose}
>Limerick
A limerick is a short, humorous poem.  It is generally about five lines long, with a strong {Rhyme} and often using sexual innuendo as its source of humour.

See also {Poetry}; {Prose}; {Text}; {Prosody}
>Rhetorical Question
A rhetorical question is a question whose answer is so obvious that the listener is not expected to supply the answer.  It can also be used to create an effect; if someone asks 'Who knows?' they could mean that they do not know.  It might also imply that they are not very bothered about knowing either

See also {Figure of Speech}; {Question}; {Tautology}; 
>Grammar
A grammar  is a description of the rules of the structure of a language; the way words combine, the order they come in, the way they change according to their relationship to other words, how they build up into units like a {Sentence} etc..

See Also {Descriptive Grammar}; {Prescriptive Grammar}; {Syntax}; {Semantics}; {Etymology}
>Descriptive Grammar
A descriptive grammar looks at the way a language is actually used by its speakers and then attempts to analyse it and formulate rules about the structure.  This kind of grammar does not deal with what is good or bad language use; forms and structures that might not be used by speakers of {Standard English} would be regarded as valid and included.  It is a grammar based on the way a language actually is and not how some think it should be.

See also {Grammar}; {Prescriptive Grammar}; {Syntax}
>Prescriptive Grammar
A prescriptive grammar lays out rules about the structure of a language.  Unlike a {Descriptive Grammar} it deals with what the grammarian believes to be right and wrong, good or bad language use; not following the rules will generate incorrect language.  Both types of grammar have their supporters and their detractors, which in all probability suggests that both have their strengths and weaknesses.

See also {Grammar}; {Standard English}; {Syntax}; {Dialect}
>Negative
A negative structure can show the absence of a {Noun} or any other {Substantive}, the non-performance of the action described by a {Verb}, or the non-existence in the case of a {Stative Verb}.  An {Adverb} or {Adjective} can equally be negated so that it expresses the absence of the quality or characteristic described.  Negation can be used to break the linking function of a {Preposition} so that the items governed by it are shown to be separate.

Unless it is tied to something quantifiable, the number zero or nought simply implies an absence of anything numerically quantifiable.  In contrast, negation in language functions in a contradictory way; it invokes a connection, action, modification, etc., only to then deny it.  However, a negative nearly always creates a ghostly presence of the very thing it is saying is absent.  Something may well not be green, but in learning that our image and understanding of whatever it is coloured by the green whose absence is a characteristic.

This ingenious mechanism common to all languages is one of the driving forces of creativity and generators of meaning.  Through it we have access to one of the primary and most fundamental of all tools for creating shades of meaning.
>Text
A text is a body of language; it could consist of a single word like 'Ladies' or 'Gentlemen' on a toilet door right up to a complete book and can be either written or spoken.

See also {Discourse Analysis}; {Topic Sentence}; {Word}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}; {Clause}; {Letter}; {Prose}; {Poetry}; {Prosody}; {Paragraph}; {Grammar}; {Syntax}; {Question}; {Negative}; {Utterance}
>Topic Sentence
The topic sentence is a {Sentence} that sets out the main idea or topic of a {Paragraph}.  It is often the first sentence especially when arguing a point where it may well be followed by further information, examples etc..  If the writing is exploring a point, it frequently comes as the last sentence, drawing a conclusion from the argument.

See also {Word}; {Phrase}; {Clause}; {Letter}
>Lower Case
A lower case letter is the small version; a,b,c,d,e,f,g are lower case, but A,B, C, D, E, F, G, are Capital Letters.

See also {Alphabet}; {Capital Letter}; {Upper Case}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}; {Sentence};
>Upper Case
In writing, letters can be written two ways; T or t, for instance.  T is a capital letter, or upper case, and t is lower case.  Capital letters are used at the beginning of a {Sentence} and for a {Proper Noun}.

See also {Alphabet}; {Lower Case}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}; {Sentence};
>Capital Letter
In writing, letters can be written two ways; T or t, for instance.  T is a capital letter, or upper case, and t is lower case.  Capital letters are used at the beginning of a {Sentence} and for a {Proper Noun}.

See also {Alphabet}; {Lower Case}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}; {Sentence};
>Ordinal Number
First, second, third, etc., are ordinal numbers, usually coming before a noun.  They can be written as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc..

See also {Cardinal Number}; {Number}; {Singular}; {Plural};
>Alphabet
The letters used to write a language is its alphabet.  The English alphabet consist of 26 letters:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  Upper Case

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  Lower Case

See also {Capital Letter}; {Lower Case}; {Vowel}; {Consonant}
>Indirect Speech
Indirect Speech (also called Reported Speech) is used to communicate what someone else said, but without using the exact words.

 EG: He said that he was going to come.  (The person's exact words were "I'm going to come.")  

See also {Direct Speech}; {Verb}
>Past Participle
A) The Past Participle is used for ALL perfect forms of the {Verb}:
1 {Present Perfect}
 eg: I have taken 

2 {Past Perfect}
 eg: I had taken

3 {Future Perfect}
 eg: I will have taken 

4 {Conditional Perfect} or the {3rd Conditional}
 eg: I would have taken  
B) The Past Participle is used in the {Passive} with the verb 'To Be' in most tenses.

NOTE:
The Past Participle may also be used as an {Adjective} in front of a {Noun}

See also {Participles}; {Verb}; {Present Participle}; {Auxiliary Verb}
>Present Participle
Present Participles are used with the verb 'To Be' to indicate an action that is incomplete:

 Eg: I am reading / I was reading  

They can also be used as an {Adjective}; an interesting story, a fascinating woman, etc..
See also {Participles}; {Verb}; {Past Participle}
>Demonstrative Pronoun
This; that; these; those; none and neither are demonstrative pronouns that substitute nouns when the nouns they replace can be understood from the context.  They also indicate whether they are replacing singular or plural words and give the location of the object:

 This:   singular and near the speaker
 That:   sing. and at a distance from the speaker
 These:  plural and near the speaker
 Those:  pl. and at a distance from the speaker  

 Eg. 1.: You take these bags and I'll take those.

("Those" refers to bags that are at a distance from the speaker.)

 Eg. 2: We bought this last year

("This" refers to something that is sing., near the speaker and readily understood in the context of the conversation.)

>Infinitive
The Infinitive usually occurs with the {Particle} 'To' (for example To go, To come, To wear etc.), except after an {Auxiliary Verb} or {Modal Verb}.

It is a verb form that shows no {Person}, {Tense} or {Aspect}.
 Eg: You don't know her  
 Eg: You may come  
The following verb forms are derived from the Infinitive:
 i/ {Imperative} (same as Infinitive but without 'To')   
 ii/ {Present Simple} (same as Infinitive without 'To' but the third person singular takes 's')   
 iii/ {Present Participle} or {Gerund} (same as Infinitive but add 'ing')  
 eg: If you'd been there, you would've seen it.  (The conditions were not met because the person was not there and as a result did not see it.)

 one day; two days  
Nouns ending -ch, -sh, -s, -ge, -x take -es in the plural.
  A church; two churches

>Preposition
A preposition is a word that links a {Noun}, {Pronoun} or {Gerund} to other words.  They can have a variety of meanings:

 Direction- He's going TO the shops
 Location- It's IN the box
 Time- He left AFTER the lesson had finished
 Possession- The Government OF Italy

Some phrases can function like single word prepositions; next to, in front of, etc..

See also {Prepositional Phrase}; {Complement}; {Particle}
>Prepositional Phrase
A prepositional phrase is the combination of a {Preposition} and its {Complement}:

 She left early in order to get TO THE BANK

See also {Particle}
>Particle
A particle is a {Word} that does not it into the conventional grammatical categories  the word 'to' can act as a {Preposition} describing direction; she's gone to Antwerp.  When 'to' is used with a {Verb} in the {Infinitive}, 'to abide' 'to do' etc., it is a particle, satisfying a grammatical function but without an easily defined meaning.  The term is also often employed for the words that make up a {Phrasal Verb}.  This is because words that are familiar as prepositions, which link words, are functioning in a different manner:

The plane took off an hour late.  ('off' changes the meaning of the verb but is not linking words or expressing direction, location, time or possession, which it would if it were acting as a preposition.  Hence many people prefer to call words like this particles in phrasal verbs.

See also {Prepositional Phrase}
>Article
A, AN, and THE are called ARTICLES.

 THE is the {Definite Article}
A and AN are both used for the {Indefinite Article}  

 "The boy" refers to a definite, particular boy, but "A boy" refers to no particular boy; it could be any boy. 

 When no article is used, it is sometimes referred to as the {Zero Article}.

Articles belong to a group of words which are known as {Determiner}; they restrict or specify a noun in some way.
>Zero Article
This is when a noun is used without The\a or an:
Time is money.

See also {Article}; {Definite Article}; {Indefinite Article}; {Noun}; {Singular}; {Plural}
>Definite Article

 He's gone to the shops.  (Here the listener knows which shops I mean)

It can also be used to refer back to something that has already been mentioned:
 There's a word for that.  Now, what is the word? 

It can be used to refer forwards to something that is coming:
 The key to the front door is under the mat.

It can be used to refer to a group:
 The car has changed our way of living.

See also {Aspect}; {Tense}; {Voice}; {Verb}; {Imperative}; {Subjunctive}
>Postmodifier
A postmodifier is placed after the word that it modifies:

See also {Phrase}; {Word}
>Indirect Object
The Indirect Object of a verb is not directly affected by the action, but can either receive the direct object or have the action done for them.

 EG: She sent James the letter.  ('letter' is the {Direct Object} as it is directly affected by the action and 'James' is the indirect object as he receives the letter.)
     
 EG: They made him dinner.  ('Dinner' is the direct object as it is created by the action and 'him' is the indirect object as the dinner is made for him.) 

These sentences can also be written as follows:
    
     She sent the letter to James
     They made dinner for him.

See also {Direct Object}; {Object}; {Complement}; {Verb}; {Predicate}
>Gender
A grammatical category found in many languages in which a {Noun}, {Pronoun}, {Article} and {Adjective} is masculine, feminine or neuter, although some languages only distinguish between masculine and feminine.  This distinction does not occur in English.  The only times that gender is shown in English is when the noun refers to a male or female animal, person, etc.:

  lion (male)  lioness (female)
  waiter (male)  waitress (female)
{Concord}; {Agreement}

>Demonstrative Adjective
Demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those) show whether the {Noun} they refer to is {Singular} or {Plural} and whether it is located near to or far from the speaker or writer.

See also {Adjective}; {Demonstrative}; {Demonstrative Pronoun} 
>Determiner

	2 {Numeral} two cars   the first day
	3 {Possessive Adjective} my job   their friends
	4 {Quantifier} some coffee  few tickets
	5 {Demonstrative Adjective} this tape  those books

>Adverbial
An adverbial is a group of words that functions in the same way as an {Adverb}:
 Before the play, we met up in a pub near the theatre. ('Before the play' functions in the same way as an adverb of time such as Yesterday, etc..)

See also {Verb}; {Word}
>Adverb
Most adverbs in English are formed by adding -ly to an {Adjective}.  An adverb is a word that modifies the meaning of a {Verb}; an {Adjective}; another adverb; a {Noun} or {Noun Phrase}; {Determiner}; a  {Numeral}; a {Pronoun}; or a {Prepositional Phrase} and can sometimes be used as a {Complement} of a {Preposition}.

SPELLING NOTES

i)   Adjectives ending -l still take -ly; careful-carefully.
ii)  Adjectives ending -y change to -ily; lucky-luckily
iii) Adjectives ending -ble change to -bly; responsible-responsibly

ADVERBS OF MANNER

Adverbs of manner modify a verb to describe the way the action is done.

 EG: She did the work carefully.
('Carefully' modifies the verb to describe the way the work was done, as opposed to quickly, carelessly, etc..) 

ADVERBS OF PLACE or LOCATION

Adverbs of place show where the action is done.

 EG: They live locally. 

ADVERBS OF TIME

Adverbs of time show when an action is done, or the duration or frequency.

 EG:  He did it yesterday.  (When)

      They are permanently busy. (Duration)

      She never does it. (Frequency) 

ADVERBS OF DEGREE

Adverbs of degree increase or decrease the effect of the verb.

 EG: I completely agree with you.  (This increases the effect of the verb, whereas 'partially' would decrease it.) 

ADVERBS MODIFYING ADJECTIVES

An adjective can be modified by an adverb, which precedes the adjective, except 'enough' which comes after.

 EG:  That's really good.

      It was a terribly difficult time for all of us.

      It wasn't good enough.  ('Enough' comes after the adjective.)

ADVERBS MODIFYING ADVERBS

An adverb can modify another.  As with adjectives, the adverb precedes the one it is modifying with 'enough' being the exception again.

 EG: She did it really well.  

     He didn't come last night, funnily enough.

ADVERBS MODIFYING NOUNS 

Adverbs can modify nouns to indicate time or place.

 EG: The concert tomorrow

EG:  The room upstairs  

ADVERBS MODIFYING NOUN PHRASES

Some adverbs of degree can modify noun phrases.

 EG: We had quite a good time.

     They're such good friends. 

Quite; rather; such; what (What a day!) can be used in this way.  

ADVERBS MODIFYING DETERMINERS, NUMERALS & PRONOUNS

Adverbs such as almost; nearly; hardly; about, etc., can be used:

 EG: Almost everybody came in the end.
>Inflection
INFLECTION, also spelt 'INFLEXION', is a system in which words' forms are altered by an {Affix}.  Nouns in English can be changed to show plurality, the 3rd person singular of most verbs is inflected by the addition of -s, etc..

{Syntax}; {Concord}; {Agreement}
>Prefix
Prefixes are groups of letters that can be placed before a word to modify its meaning.

 EG: impossible  (the prefix im- modifies the meaning to produce a negative sense)
     

See also {Suffix}; {Affix}; {Adjective}; {Verb}; {Noun}; {Morpheme}
>Suffix
Suffixes are groups of letters placed after a word *inflec.] to modify its meaning or change it into a different word group, from an adjective to an adverb, etc..

 EG: gladly  (the suffix -ly changes the word from an adjective to an adverb)
     approached  (the suffix -ed changes the verb from the present to the past)

See also {Prefix}; {Affix}; {Verb}; {Adverb}; {Noun}; {Adjective}; {Morpheme}; {Inflection}

>Active
English verbs can be in either the Active or the {Passive} {Voice}. Voice shows the relationship between the verb and the noun phrases.  In a sentence in the active, the person or thing that performed the action is the {Subject} of the {Verb}:
 I wrote the letter.
In a sentence in the {Passive} the {Object} of the active sentence is used as the subject of the verb:
 The letter was sent yesterday.
>Passive
FORMATION:   'TO BE' + {Past Participle}
USE:
It occurs in most tenses and changes the emphasis:
 My roof was damaged by the storm.
ie: The storm caused the damage, but the cause is less important to me than the damage to my roof, because I will have to repair it.

It is sometimes called the Passive Voice.  See {Voice}; {Mood}; {Aspect}; {Active}; {Passive Index}
>Case
Case is used in some languages to show the function of a {Noun} or {Noun Phrase} in a sentence by {Inflection}.  In English nouns have two cases:

 The dog     (General case)
 The dog's   (Genitive case- indicating possession)

Personal Pronouns have three cases:

 he              (Subject case)
 him             (Object case)
 his             (Genitive case)

Other languages can have more or fewer cases and many have none.
>2nd Conditional
FORMATION:   If + {Past Simple}, + Would + {Base Form}
USE:

1/ For future actions dependent on the result of another future action or event, where there is only a small possibility of the conditions for the action being satisfied.
 eg: If I won the lottery, I would stop working.  
2/ For imaginary present actions, where the conditions for the action are NOT satisfied.
 eg: If you phoned home more often, they wouldn't worry about you. (The conditions are not satisfied because the person does not phone home, so they do worry.)  
TO BE: In {Standard English} this verb can take the 'were' form for all persons in the If clause.
 eg: If I were you, I'd tell her.  
CONTRACTIONS: 'Would' and 'had' are contracted to 'd; the way to distinguish them is simple because 'would' is always followed by a {Base Form} and 'had', as an {Auxiliary Verb}, is followed by a {Past Participle}.
 eg: I'd tell her.  'Tell' is the {Base Form} so it means 'I would tell her' 
 I'd done it.  'Done' is the {Past Participle} so it means 'I had done it'
 eg: If he gets here soon, I'll speak to him about it.

>Transitive Verb
A Transitive Verb is one that takes an {Object}.

EG: He opened the door.  ('Door' is the object of the action; it is affected by the operation.)  

See also {Complement}; {Direct Object}; {Predicate}; {Subject}; {Auxiliary Verb}; {Causative Verb}; {Copula Verb}; {Ditransitive Verb}; {Dynamic Verb}; {Finite Verb}; {Inchoative Verb}; {Intransitive Verb}; {Irregular Verb}; {Modal Verb}; {Non-finite Verb}; {Phrasal Verb}; {Regular Verb}; {Stative Verb}; {Verb Group}; {Verb Phrase}
>Ditransitive Verb
A Ditransitive Verb is one that takes both a {Direct Object} and an {Indirect Object}.

 EG: He gave her the letter. ('The letter' is the direct object, what he gave, and 'her' is the indirect object, the person he gave it to.  This sentence can also be written 'He gave the letter to her'. 

See also {Complement}; {Direct Object}; {Predicate}; {Subject}; {Auxiliary Verb}; {Causative Verb}; {Copula Verb}; {Dynamic Verb}; {Finite Verb}; {Inchoative Verb}; {Intransitive Verb}; {Irregular Verb}; {Modal Verb}; {Non-finite Verb}; {Phrasal Verb}; {Regular Verb}; {Stative Verb}; {Verb Group}; {Verb Phrase}
>1st Conditional
FORMATION:   If + Present Simple, + Will
USE:
1/ For future actions dependent on the result of another future action or event, where there is a reasonable possibility of the conditions for the action being satisfied.
 eg: If he gets here soon, I'll speak to him about it. (The speaker believes that there is a reasonable or good chance of seeing him.)
 
See also {Conditionals}; {Modal Verb}; {2nd Conditional}; {3rd Conditional}; {Zero Conditional}; {Verb}
>3rd Conditional
FORMATION:    If + {Past Perfect}, + Would have + {Past Participle}

USE:

1/ For imaginary past actions, where the conditions for the action WERE NOT satisfied.
 eg: If you'd been there, you would've seen it.  (The conditions were not met because the person was not there and as a result did not see it.)  

See also {Conditionals}; {Modal Verb}; {1st Conditional}; {2nd Conditional}; {Zero Conditional}; {Verb}
>Abstract Noun
An abstract noun refers to states, events, concepts, feelings, qualities, etc., that have no physical existence.  
 eg: Freedom; happiness; idea; music are all Abstract Nouns that have no physical existence.  
An Abstract Noun can be either a {Countable Noun} or {Uncountable Noun}.  Abstract nouns that refer to events are almost usually countable: a noise; a meeting.

>Relative Pronoun
Relative pronouns, such as That, Who, Which, Whose and Whom can be used to introduce clauses in sentences:

The woman who interviewed me was very friendly.
I can't stand dogs that bark loudly.

See also {Relative Clause}; {Defining Relative Clause}; {Non-defining Relative Clause}; {Pronoun}; {Clause}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}
>Relative Clause
A {Clause} that modifies a {Noun} in a sentence, or a {Noun Phrase}, is a relative clause:

The woman that has just left the shop didn't buy anything.  ('that has just left the shop' modifies the noun 'woman' by telling us which woman the speaker is referring to)

See also {Relative Pronoun}; {Clause}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}; {Defining Relative Clause}; {Non-defining Relative Clause}
>Defining Relative Clause
A defining relative clause gives essential information about the {Noun} or {Noun Phrase} it modifies, without which the sentence wouldn't make sense as the listener or reader would not be able to identify the noun in the sentence:
The hotel that we stayed in wasn't bad.  ('that we stayed in' tells the listener which hotel we are talking about; it defines the hotel)

'Who', 'whose' and 'that' can be used for people.  'Which' 'whose' and 'that' can be used for things.
See also {Relative Pronoun}; {Clause}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}; {Non-defining Relative Clause}; {Relative Clause}
>Non-defining Relative Clause
This gives extra information about a {Noun} or {Noun Phrase} and has commas at both ends:
My sister, who lives in France, is coming to stay with me next week.  ('who lives in France' is not essential, which means that I only have one sister and she does not need to be defined by the relative clause)

'Who' and 'whose are used for people.  'Which' and 'whose' are used for things.  'That' cannot be used in a non-defining relative clause.

See also {Relative Pronoun}; {Clause}; {Sentence}; {Phrase}; {Defining Relative Clause}; {Relative Clause}
>Accent
i) A person's accent is the way he or she speaks, with differences in the sounds that can show the place a person comes from, or their social class.

ii) Some languages use accents to change the sound of a letter, represented in writing by a symbol over the letter.  English has no accents, except in some foreign words.

iii) The accent on a word is the greater stress put onto a syllable.  'Photographer' has the stress on the second {Syllable}, whereas 'photographic' has the stress on the third sylable

See also; {Dialect}; {Standard English}; {Received Pronunciation}; {Punctuation}
>Direct Speech
Direct speech is used to give the exact words used by another speaker.  The words are given between quotation marks ("exact wrds.") in writing:

"I'm coming now," he said.

See also {Indirect Speech}; {Punctuation}
>Reported Speech
Reported Speech (also called Indirect Speech) is used to communicate what someone else said, but without using the exact words.  A few changes are necessary; often a {Pronoun} has to be changed and the {Verb} is usually moved back a {Tense}

 EG: He said that he was going to come.  (The person's exact words were "I'm going to come.") 

See also {Direct Speech}
>Interrogative Pronoun
A Wh- question word, when it acts as a {Pronoun} is an interrogative pronoun:

What is her phone number?
Who is in charge?
See also {Pronoun}; Reflexive Pronoun} and {Possessive Adjective}; {Demonstrative Pronoun}; {Personal Pronoun}; {Possessive Pronoun}; {Reflexive Pronoun}; {Negative Pronoun}; {Reciprocal pronoun}
>Reciprocal pronoun
Phrases like 'each other' or 'one another' are reciprocal pronouns.  They show that an action is two-way:
Jane and Helen greeted each other.  (this means that Jane greeted Helen and Helen greeted Jane)

>Quantifier
A quantifier, as its name implies, expresses quantity.  They can be a single word or a phrase and are used with nouns.  They can be used with both a {Countable Noun} or an {Uncountable Noun} to express amount or quantity.
 Some, much, many, few, little, a lot, half, three, etc., are common quantifiers.

See also {Noun}; {Phrase}; {Determiner} and {Numeral}
>Animate Noun
A {Noun} which refers to people, animals and living beings is an Animate Noun.  {Inanimate Nouns} refer to things that are not alive.

>Inanimate Noun
An inanimate noun refers to things that are not alive.  An {Animate Noun} refers to living things such as people and animals.

See {Concrete Noun}; {Abstract Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}; {Noun}
>Collective Noun
A collective noun refers to a group of people, animals or objects as a group; family, company, etc..  When a collective noun is used in the singular, the verb can be either {Singular} or {Plural}:
The company has decided to open ten new outlets.
The company have decided to open ten new outlets.

NB  The police are here.  ('police' has no singular form)
If a singular {Verb} is used then the noun is seen as a single entity.  If a plural verb is used, then the noun is seen as consisting of a group of individuals.

See {Concrete Noun}; {Abstract Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}
>Aspect
Aspect in a {Verb} shows whether the action or state is complete or not:

She's doing a crossword puzzle.  (incomplete- progressive aspect)
They've washed up. 		   (complete- perfect aspect)

The progressive aspect is often called 'continuous'.

See also {Progressive Aspect}; {Perfect Aspect}; {Mood}; {Voice}; {Tense}
>Progressive Aspect
The progressive or continuous aspect is formed with the {Auxiliary Verb} 'to be' + - ing, the {Present Participle}.  It shows that an action or state, past, present, or future, was, is or will be unfinished at the time referred to:

I'm reading Nelson Mandela's autobiography.   (action unfinished now)
She was having a shower when the phone rang.  (action unfinished at the time the phone rang)

See also {Aspect}; {Perfect Aspect}; {Mood}; {Voice}; {Tense}; {Past Participle}; {Gerund}
>Perfect Aspect
The perfect aspect is formed with the {Auxiliary Verb} 'to have' + the {Past Participle}.  It is used for finished actions that are relevant to the time referred to or ones that continue up to the time referred to:

She's worked here for donkey's years.  (this continues up to now)
I've lost my keys.  			   (a past action that is relevant now as I can't open the door)
See also {Aspect}; {Progressive Aspect}; {Mood}; {Voice}; {Tense}; {Present Participle}
>Finite Verb
The finite forms of a verb are the forms where the verb shows tense, person or singular \ plural.  {Non-finite Verb} forms have no person, tense or number.

I go, she goes, he went - These verb forms are finite.
To go, going - These verb forms are non-finite.

>Participles
There are two participles in English: the {Present Participle} and the {Past Participle}.  They can both be used as an {Adjective}

The present participle is formed by adding -ING to the {Base Form}.  It is used in i){Continuous Verbs}Continuous} and as an ii){Adjective}:

 EG: i) I'm leaving in five minutes.
    ii) A dying man.  

The past participle is formed by adding -ED to the base form, unless it is an {Irregular Verb}.  It is used as an i) {Adjective}, ii) with  the {Auxiliary Verb} 'have' to form the {Perfect} and iii) with the verb 'be' to form the {Passive}.

 EG: i)  A tired group.
    ii)  They've just arrived.
   iii)  He was robbed a couple of days ago.

>Standard English
Standard English is the variety of English that is held to be 'correct' in the sense that it shows none of the regional or other variations that are considered by some to be ungrammatical, Non-Standard English.  {Received Pronunciation}, often called , is the way Standard English is spoken; without regional variations.  Standard English and RP are widely used in the media and by public figures, so it has prestige status and is regarded by many as the most desirable form of the language.

Give me that.					(pronoun)
See also {Demonstrative Pronoun}; {Demonstrative Adjective}
>Dynamic Verb
A dynamic verb is one that can be used in the {Progressive Aspect}, indicating an unfinished action.

>Complement
A complement is the part of a {Sentence} that comes after the {Verb} and is needed to make the sentence complete.  The following are the most important types of complement used in English:
SUBJECT COMPLEMENT
He's a surveyor.  (The {Subject} is completed by the complement to the verb.  This is a {Copula Verb}.

OBJECT COMPLEMENT
She sent him the fax.  (The sentence is completed by telling us what she sent to him.)

ADJECTIVAL COMPLEMENT
They'll be happy.  (The sentence is completed by the {Adjective}; this could be extended further, they'll be happy to see us, etc..)

 PREPOSITIONAL COMPLEMENT
They talked about what needed doing.  (The sentence is completed by the {Phrase} linked to the verb by the {Preposition}.) 
>Conditionals

The conditionals are used to talk about possible or imaginary situations.

1/ {1st Conditional}
2/ {2nd Conditional}
3/ {3rd Conditional}
4/ {Zero Conditional}
5/ {Mixed Conditionals}
6/ {Other Conditionals}

See also {Modal Verb};
>Zero Conditional
FORMATION:    If + {Present Simple}Simple Present}, + {Present Simple}
USE:
1/ For actions that are always true when the conditions are satisfied.
 eg: If you put sugar in coffee, it tastes sweet.

See also {1st Conditional}; {2nd Conditional}; {3rd Conditional}; {Modal Verb}; {Mixed Conditionals}; {Other Conditionals}
>Mixed Conditionals

i) Third \ Second
FORMATION: If + {Past Perfect}, + Would + {Base Form}
USE: 
1/ For imaginary present actions or situations that are not possible because the necessary conditions were not met in the past.
 eg: If you had taken the course, you would know about it.  (The conditions were not met because the person did not do the course and as a result does not know about it now.) 

ii) Second \ Third
FORMATION: If + {Past Simple}, + Would have + {Past Participle}
USE:
1/ To avoid the illogicality of saying 'If I had been you', which means that I was not you on that occasion, but could be in the future, which is, of course, impossible.
 eg:If I were you, I wouldn't have done that.

2/ Where the first part is still true:
 eg:If I could speak Spanish, I wouldn't have needed to get the letter translated.
This means that I couldn't speak Spanish then when I needed the translator and still can't.

See also {1st Conditional}; {2nd Conditional}; {3rd Conditional}; {Modal Verb}; {Zero Conditional}; {Other Conditionals}
>Other Conditionals

i) WILL \ WILL

 eg: I'd never heard of it until last week.  

See also {Present Perfect}; {Aspect}; {Perfect Aspect}; {Progressive Aspect}; {Auxiliary Verb}; {Future Perfect}; {Tense}
>Future Perfect
FORMATION:   'WILL HAVE' + {Past Participle}
USE:
1/ For actions to be completed before a specific future time, but the exact time is unimportant.
 eg: She'll have finished it by next week.  
2/ When making assumptions about actions that are finished now.
 eg: It's OK to phone because he'll have got home by now. 

 See also {Present Perfect}; {Aspect}; {Perfect Aspect}; {Progressive Aspect}; {Auxiliary Verb}; {Future Perfect}; {Tense}
>Imperative
Imperatives are verbs used to give orders, commands and instructions.  The form used is usually the same as the {Base Form}.  It is one of the three moods of an English {Verb}.  Imperatives should be used carefully in English; to give firm orders or commands, but not as much when trying to be polite or show respect to the other person.
	eg: Give me that tape, please.

See also {Mood}; {Declarative}; {Subjunctive}; {Voice}; {Aspect}; {Tense}
>Declarative
The Declarative {Mood} is the normal form of a verb, in contrast with the {Imperative} and the {Subjunctive}.

>Present Continuous
This if formed with the present tense of the verb TO BE and the {Present Participle}.  It is used for actions that have begun but not finished.  It can also be used to talk about future arrangements.
>Acrostic
An acrostic is a poem where the first letter of each line form a word or phrase when read together.

See also {Acronym}; {Phrase}; {Letter}; {Word}; {Palindrome}; {Synecdoche}
>Euphemism
When talking or writing about subjects that we find embarrassing or unpleasant, we often use language that is less direct and vague; rather than say that somebody has died, we might say that they 'have passed away'.  Hospitals have 'Special Clinics', which are where sexually transmitted diseases are treated.

See also {Standard English}; {Acronym}; {Palindrome}; {Synecdoche}; {Oxymoron}
>Synecdoche
When we use a word that refers to a part of something to mean the whole, this is synecdoche.  'All hands on deck' is an example in which 'hands' is used to mean 'people'.

See also {Palindrome}; {Acronym}; {Abbreviation}; {Oxymoron}; {Figure of Speech}
>Oxymoron

>Affix
An affix is a {Morpheme} added to a word to change its function or meaning.  There are three basic ways to do this:

 Prefix- by adding a morpheme to the beginning of a word:
Possible can be made the opposite in meaning by adding im-; impossible

 Suffix- by adding -ly to the end of many adjectives, the adverb can be formed; cheerful- cheerfully

 Infix- some languages add morphemes to the middle of the word, but this system is rarely used in English, except in expressions such as 'Fan-bloody-tastic'.

See also {Prefix}; {Suffix}; {Word}; {Adverb}; {Adjective}
>Polysemy
This refers to a word that has two or more similar meanings:

 The house is at the foot of the mountains
 One of his shoes felt too tight for his foot

'Foot' here refers to the bottom part of the mountains in the first sentence and the bottom part of the leg in the second.

>Palindrome
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelt the same way forwards or backwards:

'Madam' is an example

>Malapropism
Mrs Malaprop was a character in a play by the British writer Sheridan who confused words and used incorrect words that sounded similar to the {Word} she meant to say.  If someone does this it is a malapropism, like the politician who is alleged to have said that he would support a colleague to the best of his mobility, instead of ability.

See also {Figure of Speech}; {Spoonerism}; {Onomatopoeia}; {Acrostic}; {Portmanteau Word}
>Spoonerism
The Reverend Spooner is well known in England because of a speech problem he is supposed to have had; it is said that he used to mix up the first couple of letters of words, sometimes creating strange sentences.  One of the most famous spoonerism attributed to him is when he told a student off because he had 'hissed the mystery lectures' when he meant to say 'missed the history lectures'.

>Adjunct
An adjunct is part of a {Sentence} and modifies the {Verb} to show time, manner, place, frequency and degree.
 Eg: It is nearly done.  ('Nearly' describes the degree to which the action has been done.)
 Eg: I go there twice a week.  ('Twice a week' describes the frequency with which the action is done.) 

See also {Adverb}; {Adverbial}; {Conjunct}; {Disjunct}
>Homograph
Homographs are words that are written the same way but have different meanings and often different pronunciations:
'Wind' can mean the movement of air when talking about the weather.  It can also mean to follow a course or way that is not straight; the road winds through the mountains.  These are different words with different pronunciations although they are written the same way.

NB: The {Concordancer} will display homographs.

See also {Homonym}; {Homophone}; {Synonym}; {Antonym}; {Acronym}
>Homophone
Homophones are words that are spelt differently but sound the same.

'Rain', 'rein' and 'reign' are examples.

See also {Homograph}; {Homonym}; {Synonym}; {Antonym}; {Acronym}; {Allophone}
>Homonym
Homonyms are words that are written and pronounced the same way but which have different meanings.

'Lie' can be a verb meaning to tell something that is not true or to be in a horizontal position.  They look and sound the same, but are different verbs as can be seen from their forms:

>Allophone

An allophone is a different form of the same sound or {Phoneme}.  

See also {Homophone}; {Allomorph}; {Phonetics}
>Allomorph
An allomorph is a different form of a {Morpheme}.  The regular {Simple Past} ending is -ed.  In the verb 'advised' the ending is pronounced /d/, but in 'walked' it is pronounced /t/ and in 'wanted' it is pronounced /i:d/.  A verb ending in -e, like 'hire' only takes -d.  These are different forms of the same thing; they are allomorphs of the simple past tense ending.
>Phoneme
A phoneme is the smallest sound in a language.  The English phonemes are represented in the {Phonetic Alphabet}.

See also {Allophone}; {Morpheme}; {Phonetics}
>Predicate
A simple sentence can be divided into two parts; the {Subject} and the Predicate, which is the verb and any {Complement} of the {Verb}, which can include the {Object}, {Adverbial},etc..

SUBJECT   PREDICATE
 EG. She       laughed.
     She       wrote a book. 

See also {Subject}; {Verb Phrase}; {Noun Phrase}; {Predicative Adjective}
>Copula Verb
A copula verb is a verb that connects the {Subject} to the {Complement}.  They are sometimes called linking verbs.

EG: That food smells nice.

('Smells' connects the subject to the adjective that describes it.)

The following are the principle Copula Verbs in English that can be used to connect the subject to an {Adjective}:

Be; Look; Feel; Taste; Smell; Sound; Seem; Appear; Get; Become; Grow; Stay; Keep; Turn; Prove; Go; Remain; Resemble; Run; Lie

>Adjectival Noun
An {Adjective} can sometimes function as a {Noun}; the young, the rich, etc..  These are Adjectival Nouns, meaning the people who are young, the people who are rich, etc..
>Noun as Adjective
We can use a noun as an adjective when it precedes a noun that it modifies; a mountain bike is a bike designed for riding up mountains.  'Mountain' functions as an adjective modifying the noun 'bike'.  The second noun takes the plural form, while the first behaves like an adjective and consequently does not.

We use these for well-known things, some can be hyphenated and some are written as one word.

See {Concrete Noun}; {Proper Noun}; {Adjectival Noun}; {Noun as Adjective}; {Animate Noun}; {Inanimate Noun}; {Collective Noun}; {Mass Noun}; {Substantive}; {Adjective}
>Onomatopoeia
A word which imitates the sound it represents is an onomatopoeia; 'splash' sounds similar to the noise of something falling into water.

See also {Oxymoron}; {Palindrome}; {Phoneme}; {Tautology}
>Acronym
An acronym is a kind of Abbreviation.  It is  a word formed by taking letters from a phrase that is too long to use comfortably.

Laser is an acronym of Light AMplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

See also {Abbreviation}; {Portmanteau Word}; {Synonym}; {Antonym}; {Hyponym}; {Examples of Acronyms};
>Portmanteau Word
A portmanteau word is formed out of parts of other words.  Oxbridge is  made up from parts of the names of Oxford and Cambridge and refers to one of the two universities.  'Swatch' is a portmanteau word formed from SWiss wATCH, 'brunch' is formed from BReakfast and lUNCH.
A 'chocoholic' has a problem with chocolate that is like the addiction of an alcoholic.

>Minimal Pair
A minimal pair consists of two words that have just one difference in sound with different meanings. 'Ship' and 'Sheep' are a minimal pair.  

See also {Phoneme}; {Allophone}; {Homophone}
>Neologism
A neologism is a new word that comes into use.  Technology is an area particularly rich in them; CD, Internet, information superhighway, etc..

See also {Loan Word}; {Euphemism}; {Acronym}; {Jargon}
>Loan Word
A loan word is a word taken from a different language.  'Avant garde' is a loan from French, 'marmalade' is from Portuguese, etc.

See also {Neologism}; {Euphemism}; {Portmanteau Word}; {Onomatopoeia}; {Jargon}
>Dyad
Two people speaking is a dyad; the smallest unit of communication.  Relationships between people; employer \ employee,etc, are dyads as well.

See also {Phoneme}; {Morpheme}; {Idiolect}
>Hyponym
A word whose meaning is part of the meaning of another word in a hyponym; a 'rose' is a hyponym of 'plant' because it is a plant, but plant has a wider meaning than rose. 'Plant' is a {Superordinate}of rose.  Other hyponyms of plant would include all different individual plants.

See also {Synonym} and {Antonym}
>Morpheme
A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning.  A word can contain more than one morpheme:

 'Unable' can be divided into two morphemes- the {Prefix} 'un' and 'able', whereas the word 'mahogany' cannot be divided into anything smaller.

See also {Phoneme}; {Affix}; {Suffix}; {Word}
>Superordinate
A superordinate is a general term that includes various different words representing narrower categories, called hyponyms:

Superordinate: 	Animal
{Hyponym}:		Cat, horse, etc..

See also {Synonym}; {Hyponym}; {Antonym}; {Acronym}
>Subjunctive
The subjunctive is the {Mood} of a {Verb}, used to show hopes doubts wishes etc..  It is not used very much in modern English surviving in a few expressions such as 'If I were you' in the {2nd Conditional} and expressions like 'God save the Queen' and 'so be it'.

See also {Modal Verb}; {Voice}; {Tense}; {Aspect}
>Inchoative Verb
An inchoative verb is a verb that describes a change of state.

	The apples ripened.  (The apples became ripe.)
	He has aged a lot.   (He has become old.)

>Collocation
When words are used together regularly, rules are formed about their use not for grammatical reasons, but because of the association.  'Black and white' appear in that order because of collocation; they are always in that order and to put them the other way around seems wrong.  For the same reason we 'make a mistake' when we 'do a test'.  The reason for using these verbs with these is that we always do; this is collocation.

See also {Word}; {Figure of Speech}; {Grammar}
>Concord
When words have a grammatical relationship which affects the form of one or more of the elements then they are showing concord.  'They are' shows concord because the plural subject takes the verb form associated with the plural.  

See also  {Gender}; {Number}; {Case}; {Singular}; {Plural}; {Person}; {Grammar}
>Agreement
When words have a grammatical relationship which affects the form of one or more of the elements then they agree.  THREE GIRLS shows agreement because the {Noun} is sporting the {Plural} {Inflection} which is required by the number.  It is another way of saying {Concord}

See also  {Gender}; {Number}; {Case}; {Singular}; {Plural}; {Person}; {Grammar}
>Conjunct
A conjunct relates what is said in a sentence to another sentence.  As such, it is not part of the structure of the sentence in which it is used.
 EG: However, things turned out much worse than expected.  ('However' relates what is said to contrast it with previous information about the speaker's expectations.)
     All told, we did very well.  ('All told' connects information that has already been given to produce a final conclusion that connects everything.  In both examples it is possible to remove the conjunct without making the sentence ungrammatical.)

See also  {Adverb}; {Adverbial}; {Adjunct}; {Disjunct}
>Disjunct

A disjunct expresses the speaker or writer's attitude to what is being described in the sentence.
 EG: Fortunately, we managed to get there on time.  ('Fortunately' shows us that the speaker was pleased about the result of the action.)

See also  {Adverb}; {Adverbial}; {Adjunct}; {Conjunct}
>Substantive
A Substantive is a term covering all words that can function like a {Noun}, including nouns, the {Gerund}, the {Adjectival Noun} and the {Pronoun}.
>Conditional Perfect
FORMATION:   'WOULD HAVE' + {Past Participle}
USE:
It is used in the {3rd Conditional} to talk about imaginary situations in the past:
 eg: If she'd seen the advert, she would have applied for the job.  
NOTE:
	'If she'd seen = If she had seen

See also {Conditionals}; {1st Conditional}; {2nd Conditional}; {3rd Conditional}; {Modal Verb}; {Auxiliary Verb}
>Word
A word is the smallest unit of a language that can exist on its own in either written or spoken language.  A {Morpheme} such as -ly, used to create an {Adverb} cannot exist without the {Adjective} it modifies; it is not a word, although the adjective it modifies can exist alone and, therefore, is a word:

The woman was robbed. (4 words- an {Article} a {Noun} an {Auxiliary Verb} and a {Past Participle}.  'Robbed' consists of the {Verb} 'rob' and the -ed morpheme to show that it is a past participle so the sentence has 5 morphemes.)

>Irony
Irony is common is English especially in humour.  When the speaker or writer says one thing but wants you to understand something different, they are being ironic.  Sometimes the implied meaning is the opposite of the words being used, or the person could be trying to be rude, even though the words used are seemingly polite etc..

See also {Sarcasm}; {Hyperbole}; {Understatement}; {Litotes}; {Satire}; {Word}; {Figure of Speech}
>Sarcasm
Sarcasm is a form of {Irony} that is widely used in English especially when people are being humorous.  Generally the sarcastic speaker or writer means the exact opposite of the word they use, often intending to be rude or to laugh at the person the words are addressed to.

See also {Hyperbole}; {Understatement}; {Litotes}; {Satire}; {Word}; {Figure of Speech}
>Hyperbole
Hyperbole is overstatement or exaggerated language that distorts facts by making them much bigger than they are if looked at objectively.  The media use it a lot to make stories seem more important or interesting than they really are (an apparently unfair boxing decision was described as the 'crime of the century' by one newspaper which seems excessive when compared to murder).  It may be used to entertain or more seriously.

See also {Understatement}; {Irony}; {Sarcasm}; {Litotes}; {Satire}; {Word}; {Figure of Speech}
>Understatement
The opposite of {Hyperbole}, understatement is used to make something appear smaller or less important than it really is.  It can be used to entertain or to reduce the importance of the truth; in military {Jargon}, 'collateral damage' is an understated way of describing innocent victims of military action.

See also {Irony}; {Sarcasm}; {Litotes}; {Word}; {Figure of Speech}; {Metaphor}; {Simile}
>Litotes
Litotes is a kind of {Understatement}, where the speaker or writer uses a negative of a word ironically, to mean the opposite in the strongest possible way:
She's not the friendliest person I know.  (= she's the most unfriendly person I know)

See also {Irony}; {Sarcasm}; {Hyperbole}; {Satire}; {Word}; {Figure of Speech}
>Jargon
Jargon is the language used by people who work in a particular area or who have a common interest; layers computer programmers, criminals etc. all have specialised terms and expressions that they use, many of which may not be comprehensible to the outsider.  They may also use familiar words with different meanings as well as abbreviations, acronyms etc..

See also {Idiolect}; {Dialect}; {Acronym}; {Abbreviation}; {Slang}; {Figure of Speech}; {Neologism}
>Idiolect
A person's idiolect is their own personal language, the words they choose and any other features that characterise their speech and writing.  Some people have distinctive features in their language; these would be part of their idiolect, their individual linguistic choices and idiosyncrasies.

See also {Dialect}; {Jargon}; {Slang}; {Figure of Speech}
>Slang
Slang is language at its most informal, using expressions that many would consider to be grammatically imperfect and sometimes rude.  It is often used within small social groups where it can help draw and keep the group together.  It changes very quickly in English.

See also {Colloquial}; {Jargon}; {Dialect}; {Idiolect}; {Standard English}; {Figure of Speech}
>Colloquial
Colloquial language is informal language that is not rude, but would not be used in formal situations.  It is less unacceptable than {Slang} & (Swear Words)
>Swear Words
The unacceptable and rude words of a language are known as the Swear Words , or Bad Language.  They include the strongest and most offensive words; stronger than {Slang} & {Colloquial} language.
>Satire
Satire is a form of humour where the writer or speaker tries to make the reader or listener have a negative opinion about someone, by laughing at them, making them seem ridiculous or foolish etc.  If someone is being satirical, their aim is not just to amuse, but to affect the person that they dislike; to hurt them ruin them, etc..

See also {Irony}; {Sarcasm}; {Hyperbole}; {Understatement}; {Litotes}; {Figure of Speech}
>Tautology
TAUTOLOGY is where two near-synonyms are placed consecutively or very close together for effect.  If used sparingly, it can give emphasis.  If used excessively it soon becomes wearisome and boring.  Not to mention dull and uninteresting.  Sometimes you'll come across a {Superordinate} adjacent to a {Hyponym}; A REPTILIAN SNAKE.  REPTILIAN is the derived from the REPTILE family of animals, which includes snakes, lizards and crocodiles.  REPTILE is a superordinate of SNAKE, and SNAKE a HYPONYM of REPTILE.  Together they make for a TAUTOLOGICAL pairing.

{Figure of Speech}; {Rhetorical Question}; {Synonym}; {Antonym}
>Figure of Speech
A figure of speech is where a {Word} or words are used to create an effect, but where they do not have their original or literal meaning.  If someone says that they are 'staring', they do not mean that they are in fact dying of hunger, but that they are very hungry. This is a simple example of a figure of speech, where the word is used to heighten or increase the state that they are describing.  A {Metaphor} or a {Simile} are two of the most common forms used.

See also {Irony}; {Hyperbole}; {Sarcasm}; {Slang}; {Jargon}; {Tautology}; {Understatement}; {Litotes}; {Rhetorical Question}; {Cliche}; {Allegory}
>Metaphor
A metaphor is a {Word} or {Phrase} that describes one thing being used to describe another; on a simple level a phrase such as 'the heart of the matter' is a metaphor as matters do not actually have hearts.  Metaphorical phrases are widely used in English.

See also {Figure of Speech}; {Simile}; {Hyperbole}; {Understatement}; {Litotes}; {Irony}; {Sarcasm}; {Allegory}
>Simile
A simile is a comparison between two different things, designed to create an unusual,  interesting, emotional or other effect often using words such as 'like' or 'as ... as'.  Common comparisons with the qualities associated with animals (as sly as a fox, as brave as a lion, etc.) are simple examples.

>Readability Test
There are a number of tests that are designed to give a statististical analysis of the difficulty of a text.  While any attempt to reduce language use, which is inherently creative, to statistics can be criticised, they can be used to give an approximate indication.

See the {Passive Index}; the {Fog Index}; the {Flesch-Kincaid Index}; the {Lexical Density Test} for details on individual methods of calculating the score for a text.  In addition to these tests, other possible tests include the number of different words used, the number of long words, the average {Sentence} length and the average number of words or sentences in a paragraph.  The Analysis, Graph and Statistics sections of this program allow you to analyse language in many of these, and other ways.

See also {Concordancer}
>Concordancer
A concordancer is a kind of search engine designed for language study.  If you enter a word, it looks through a large body of texts, called a corpus, a lists every single example of the word.  The search is graphic, so a {Homograph} will be displayed.  This lets you look at a word in context, see how common it is, see the style associated with it etc..  This program contains a powerful concordancer that allows you to do this and many other searches, as well as multiple searches that make it possible to compare more than one word simultaneously.  Furthermore, using the graphs and statistics, you can analyse words and texts in a variety of interesting and useful ways.  This tool is a computer-specific tool that you may not be familiar with from learning English by more traditional ways, but it is worth spending some time experimenting with it and getting to know how to use it and harnessing its potential.  In addition to showing you a clear and objective picture of language use, it can help you with words that you are unsure of, which is of great use or grammatical words and, probably to a lesser extent with vocabulary.  You can use it to compare you usage with that of native speakers or other learners and, once you get to know it quite well, you can use it to explore attitudes the thought processes that lie behind the words.
